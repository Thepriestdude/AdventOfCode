// build a list of transformers that are applied inside a loop for each seed

// setup transformer interface with transform method returning taking an int and returning an int

// setup a list of transformers that implement the transformer interface
//  - each transformer is initialized with Array<Array<int>>
//  - the transform method that takes an int and returns an int

// all transformers are initialized at the start of the program with an initial seed value

// each transformer is applied to the seed value in a loop until there are no more transformers to apply
